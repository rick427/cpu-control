#### CPU CONTROL ####
Cpu control is a cross platform desktop application built with the ELECTRON framework for managing your CPU tasks. Unlik e traditional desktop app that launch as a window on startup, *cpu-control* doesn't. Instead on start, it launches in your tray and can be expanded on clicking on the app's icon there.

*cpu-control* also leverages a *"local storage"* by creating a *"database"* of sorts on your machine to store changes made to the app, so settings persist on quit and startup. Really cool ryt ? üòé
