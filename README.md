#### CPU CONTROL ####
Cpu control is a cross platform desktop application built with the ELECTRON framework for managing your CPU tasks. Unlike traditional desktop apps that launch as a window on startup, *cpu-control* doesn't. Instead on start, it launches in your tray and can be expanded on by clicking the app's icon there.

*cpu-control* also leverages a kind of *"local storage"* by creating a *"database"* of sorts on your machine to store changes made to the app, so settings persist on quitting the app and startup. Really cool ryt ? üòé

### WANT A DEMO ? ###
To execute a production demo of the app take the following steps üßê:
- Clone or download this repo
- Mac users, run the command: *npm run package-mac* from the root of the project
- Windows users, run the command: *npm run package-win* from the root of the project
- Linux users, run the command: *npm run package-linux* from the root of the project

Following these steps creates a release-builds folder, where you find an executable file for the app. ü§Ø
